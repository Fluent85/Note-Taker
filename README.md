# Note-Taker

This is my first attempt at utilizing express to develop a note taker. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
 

## Motivation

Practice express and learn more about this backend language.

## How to use? 

The user will be able to write and save notes. The user will also be able to delete notes they have written before
SO they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.


## Issues and future development

Updated server.js file, note taker now saves and deletes notes.  I had to add return res.json(notes) to my basic route and also res.json({deletion:"success"}) to my delete function.
